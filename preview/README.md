# Preview placeholder

This directory contains a simple placeholder page (`index.html`) used to
prevent 404 responses when using preview/forwarding services (codespaces,
app.github.dev, etc.) that expect a file at a particular path.

If you want a custom preview page or a different path, tell me what to add
and I'll update it.
